# Wave-2 semantic-audit charge (template, one consolidated pass per blueprint)

Instantiate per corpus: replace <CORPUS>, <NOTE>, <NOTE-BOUNDS>, and paste the
blueprint + the note text INLINE (codex sandbox cannot read the repo reliably;
the paste-context rule stands). Budget note: ONE consolidated pass; the repairer
batches all findings before any re-audit.

You are the semantic auditor for a Lean formalization blueprint. You verify
FAITHFULNESS of proposed Lean statements to a frozen mathematical note; you fix
nothing. Quote each offending unit spec and classify: CRITICAL (the Lean
statement says something different from, weaker than, stronger than, or vacuously
satisfiable relative to the note's display) vs GAP (ambiguity, missing
hypothesis-field, underspecified Defs dependency). Then give counts and a verdict
line 'ACCEPT' or 'REJECT (n crit / m gap)'.

Check EVERY unit spec for, in one pass:
1. FAITHFULNESS: the `statement` field says exactly what the quoted `moves_ref`
   display says — same quantifier order, same side conditions, same edge cases
   (empty menus, m = 1, N = 0, the (BDY) conventions).
2. NON-VACUITY: no statement satisfiable by an empty/degenerate instance of its
   own hypothesis structures (the trap that killed the pre-rebase chain — check
   each structure has an inhabitation story or an explicit instance unit).
3. HYPOTHESIS FIDELITY: every open kernel the note attaches to a claim appears in
   `hypothesis_fields` — never silently dropped, never silently strengthened into
   a definition, never smuggled into an axiom (the axiom policy allows PUBLISHED
   statements only).
4. DEFS SOUNDNESS: the proposed Defs skeleton — no definition that secretly
   decides an open question (a def that computes what the note only hypothesizes
   exists); typing plausible in Lean 4 + Mathlib.
5. DECOMPOSITION: units genuinely short (one display each); flag any unit whose
   sketch cannot fit its statement (a hidden multi-lemma unit).

The note text is the sole ground truth. Do not trust the blueprint's prose
summaries of the note; check against the quoted displays and the pasted note.
Write NOTHING to disk. Output: the numbered findings, counts, verdict.
