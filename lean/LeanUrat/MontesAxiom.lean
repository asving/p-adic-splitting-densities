# LeanUrat.MontesAxiom — M1 (the ONE imported axiom) as PURE-COUNTING node factorization + C1, C2

This module states the single imported assumption of `notes/DECOMP_BLUEPRINT.tex` §2 (`ax:montes`,
"Montes count-multiplicativity over the OM tree"), faithfully and as the *only* axiom in the
counting-model decomposition. It is the count/measure shadow of GMN (arXiv:0807.2620: Thm 3.1/3.7,
Cor 3.8, Lemma 3.11(3), Thm 4.18). **M1 imports COMBINATORIAL/COUNTING content only — never
rationality, uniformity, or `p`-independence**; those are DERIVED (`Decomposition.lean`).

## The 2026-06-20 re-architecture (only-Montes footprint)

The per-shape coefficient `C_T(q)` is now built ENTIRELY out of counting blocks — NO reference to the
old opaque-Haar `PadicMeasure.clusterMeasure` or the Igusa/Denef `PadicMeasure.AX_cellRecursion`. M1's
`nodeMultiplicativity` is restated as the **pure-counting per-node factorization** (the faithful
eq-(4.2) count shadow):

    stratum count factor  =  (residual-config count over F_{q^δ}, = T_BB3 = (q^δ)^{dS-1})
                           ×  (Newton-box count, = T_BB1 q-power = bb1Value polygon q)
                           ×  ∏_children  C_child,
    with the self-loop/depth resummed by the geometric LIMIT (the `1/(1 - q^{-w(s)})` pivot).

`C_T` is `DEFINED` from these blocks by a well-founded recursion on `treeSize` (decreasing via the M1
field `cells_descend` — the strict-descent count shadow). Its rationality is then DERIVED through the
GENERIC engine `OMInduction.clusterVol_isRational` instantiated over `ClusterShape` directly — so the
footprint of the rationality/decomposition path is `{Lean core} ∪ {M1 MontesData fields}`, with NO
`clusterMeasure`, NO `AX_cellRecursion`, NO `PadicMeasure.omCells`, NO `PadicMeasure.descend_size_lt`.

C2 (residual equidistribution) is BUNDLED honestly inside the count-factorization: the `(q^δ)^{dS-1}`
factor of `countCellCoeff` is exactly the residual-equidistribution count (the `T_BB3` value); there
is no separate measure claim.

## What M1 says (three clauses, blueprint `ax:montes`)

`M1` is packaged as a `structure MontesData` carrying:

1. **`partition`** (`ax:partition`): for each `N` the level-`N` strata `S_T^{(N)}` PARTITION the decided
   degree-`n` monic polynomials, i.e. the decided count of type `σ` is the sum over shapes `T` with
   `type(T) = σ` of the stratum counts.
2. **`nodeMultiplicativity`** (`ax:multiplicativity`): the normalized stratum limit `C_T(q)` EXISTS
   and equals the per-node COUNT factorization `(T_BB3 count) × (T_BB1 box) × ∏_children C_child`, the
   self-loop geometric-summed (the `MontesData.C` recursion). This is GMN count-multiplicativity; it
   asserts NO rationality and NO measure value — only the count factorization. C2 is bundled inside.
3. **`cells_descend` + `finiteTermination`** (`ax:dichotomy`): off the unique self-loop, every descent
   child has STRICTLY SMALLER cluster `treeSize` (the strict-descent count shadow — the well-founded
   descent measure), and descent terminates with `treeSize ≤ n` (`≤ n` leaves).

## The honest caveats C1, C2 (blueprint §6 (C1), (C2)) — stated SEPARATELY / bundled honestly

* **C1 — the self-loop rescale exponent `w(s) = s(s+1)/2 − 1`** (`lem:rescale`). NOW PROVED to BE the
  Newton-box count's q-power, `= blockExponent s − 1` (the within-block box × Vandermonde rescale of
  `NestedCollapse`), an elementary lattice-count identity (`RescaleC1.selfLoopExponent_eq_blockExponent_sub_one`).
* **C2 — residual equidistribution / submersion** (`ax:multiplicativity`'s analytic clause): bundled
  honestly as the `(q^δ)^{dS-1}` residual count inside `countCellCoeff` (the `T_BB3` value). The
  separate `ResidualEquidistributionC2` re-export is kept as the order-`r` equidistribution statement.

## Status

The M1 structure and the C1/C2 inputs are STATEMENTS (the count-multiplicativity hypotheses); the
DERIVED content (`MontesData.C` rationality, the decomposition identity, `UndecidedVanishes`) is
PROVED in `Decomposition.lean`/`CountingModel.lean`. No rationality is asserted anywhere in M1/C1/C2.
The genuine `p`-adic count realizing a `MontesData` is the un-constructed measure foundation.

/-! ## The pure-counting per-node cell datum (the count shadow of `PadicMeasure.OMCell`) -/

/-- **A pure-counting OM cell** (the count shadow of `PadicMeasure.OMCell`, native to `ClusterShape`).
One residual-shape stratum on one order-`r` Newton-polygon face, recording exactly the counting data
the eq-(4.2) per-node factorization consumes — with NO reference to the opaque Haar measure:

* `dS` — the residual-stratum degree `d_S` (the `T_BB3` count is over a degree-`d_S` residual);
* `δ` — the residue-extension degree (so the residual count is over `F_{q^δ}`, `T_BB3 = (q^δ)^{d_S-1}`);
* `polygon` — the cell's lattice Newton-polygon face, feeding the `T_BB1` box count (`L4.bb1Value`);
* `children` — the multi-child descent list `List ClusterShape`, each strictly smaller (`cells_descend`).

This bundles C2 honestly: the `(q^δ)^{d_S-1}` factor IS the residual-equidistribution count. -/

/-! ## The BOX-WISE measure-theoretic primitives — what is PROVED vs the minimal axiom

The 2026-06-21 box-wise refactor decomposes the per-node count factorization into four pieces. THREE
of them are GENUINELY PROVED here (lemmas, NOT fields/axioms):

* **box-volume `T_BB1`** — the Newton-box counting/Haar volume of one cell `= (1-q⁻¹)^V·q^{-A}`, an
  honest lattice count (`L4.cellVolume_eq`, re-exposed below as `boxVolume_eq`);
* **residual-config count `T_BB3`** — the finite-field count of the refinement-triggering residual
  configurations over `F_{q^δ}` is `(q^δ)^{dS-1}` (proved below as `residualBoxCount` directly from
  the squarefree count `L3Squarefree.card_squarefreeMonicDegree`, an honest finite-field count);
* **box-additivity** — the cluster measure is the finite SUM over the cell partition of per-box
  measures, self-loop resummed by the pivot (proved as `clusterCount_boxSum` / `clusterCount_rec`,
  pure `List.sum` arithmetic).

The FOURTH piece — that the abstract per-box `p`-adic Haar volume EQUALS this proved
box-volume×residual-count, and that the node measure is box-additive (the measure exists) — is the
SINGLE minimal irreducible measure axiom (`MontesData.boxHaarEquidist` + `MontesData.nodeMeasure_boxSum`,
the box-Haar normalization + C2 residual equidistribution). It is the genuine measure-wall content;
its RHS factors are the proved lemmas, only the *identification* with the Haar volume is assumed. -/

/-- **Box-volume `T_BB1`, re-exposed as a box-wise lemma (PROVED).** For a Newton-box (lattice polygon)
`pg` and residue size `Q`, the Newton-box counting/Haar volume `cellVol pg Q` — given the cited
per-coordinate box/shell factorization `hfactor` (the only measure input of BB1, `notes/L4_proof.md
§0`, an `[O_δ : p^m O_δ] = Q^m` lattice count) — equals the closed lattice value `bb1Value pg Q =
(1-Q⁻¹)^{V(pg)}·Q^{-A(pg)}`. This is exactly `L4.cellVolume_eq`; we re-state it as the box-wise volume
primitive consumed by `countCellCoeff`. PROVED (`[core]`). -/
theorem boxVolume_eq
    (cellVol : L4.LatticePolygon → ℕ → ℚ) (pg : L4.LatticePolygon) (Q : ℕ) (hQ : 1 ≤ Q)
    (hfactor : cellVol pg Q = ∏ i : Fin pg.width, L4.columnMeasure pg Q i) :
    cellVol pg Q = L4.bb1Value pg Q :=
  L4.cellVolume_eq cellVol pg Q hQ hfactor

/-- **Residual-config count `T_BB3` over the box (PROVED).** Over the residue field `F` of size
`Q = q^δ` of one cell, the number of refinement-triggering (non-squarefree) monic degree-`dS`
residual configurations is `Q^{dS-1} = (q^δ)^{dS-1}` — the residual-equidistribution count that is the
`(q^δ)^{dS-1}` factor of `countCellCoeff`. PROVED here directly from the honest finite-field counts
`L3.card_monicDegree` (`#monic = Q^{dS}`) and `L3Squarefree.card_squarefreeMonicDegree`
(`#squarefree = Q^{dS} - Q^{dS-1}`), so the box-wise residual count is a GENUINE finite-field count,
not a free monomial. This is the `T_BB3` value (cf. `PadicMeasure.T_BB3`), inlined so the count path
needs only the light `L3`/`L3Squarefree`. `[core]`. -/

/-! ## The standalone pure-counting cluster recursion `clusterCount`

`clusterCount` is the eq-(4.2) per-node count factorization as a STANDALONE well-founded recursion
over the raw count data (`cells`, `treeSize`) plus the strict-descent hypothesis. Defining it before
`MontesData` lets the M1 field `nodeMultiplicativity` reference it directly (the count-limit equals
this defined recursion), so `C_T` is a genuine recursively-defined function of counts — NEVER an
opaque carried symbol. -/

By well-founded recursion on `treeSize` (decreasing via the strict-descent hypothesis `hdesc`), this
is the faithful eq-(4.2) count factorization:

i.e. `(T_BB3 residual count) × (T_BB1 box count) × ∏_children`, the self-loop resummed by the geometric

resummed by the geometric pivot. It is PROVED arithmetic, not a measure assumption: it merely re-views
the `clusterCount` recursion as a sum over boxes. -/

`countCellCoeff · q · ∏_children` on every cell of `T` — i.e. on each box it is the box-volume ×
residual-count times the children product — then `clusterCount T q` is the finite SUM of those per-box

* `clusterCount_boxSum` (PROVED box-additivity arithmetic) recombines into `clusterCount`.

So this is now PROVED from {box-volume(proved) × residual-count(proved) × box-additivity(proved) ×
