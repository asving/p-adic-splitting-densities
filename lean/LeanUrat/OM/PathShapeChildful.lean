Scratch module: CHILDFUL S3 constructor extension — the single-side path shape
carrying genuine μ ≥ 2 descent children.  Namespace LeanUrat.OM.PathShapeChildful.
Math-first, no sorry/axiom/native_decide.

This module extends PathShape.oneSideShape to inject non-empty ShapeCell.children
(one childShape (μ·D) per μ ≥ 2 factor with μ·D < s), exercising the NON-VACUOUS
WF-descent guard, the cellMult = μ face read, and the pivot self-loop factors.

/-! ## 0. The childShape-collapse lemma (empty-payload child, KEEPING the pivot) -/

/-- **`omChildCount` on a `childShape`.**  `childShape sz = ⟨[(2, sz, 0)], []⟩` has an EMPTY
payload (`cells = []`), so its WF cell list is empty (the descent guard is vacuous, as in
`gate7_junk_value`).  The single configuration then has an empty face-shape (mCell `= 1`),
`volExp = 0`, and no descent children.  With `treeSize (childShape sz) = sz`, the cluster count
collapses to the bare pivot factor `1 / countPivot sz`.  This is the self-loop mass the finite
stratum density does NOT capture — the source of the pivot mismatch. -/

/-- **The childful single-side path cluster shape.**  A size-`s` order-1 cluster
(tree slot `[(1, s, 1)]`) carrying ONE `ShapeCell` PER FACTOR of `shape`: each `(D, μ)` part `q`
becomes a cell with `dS = q.1`, `δ = 1`, the shared side polygon `mkPoly s [pr.1, pr.2]`, and —
UNLIKE `oneSideShape` — a NON-EMPTY child list `[childShape (μ·D)]` exactly when `2 ≤ μ` and
`μ·D < s` (the descent-emission guard).  For an all-`μ=1` shape this reduces to `oneSideShape`. -/

`oneSideShape`, the descent premise is now genuine: an emitted child `childShape (μ·D)` must have

cluster tree `[(1, s, 1)]` gives `nodeSizeOf T = s`; `childShape (μ·D)`'s head slot `[(2, μ·D, 0)]`
gives `nodeSizeOf = μ·D`; the emission guard `μ·D < s` discharges the descent. -/

/-- **The engine child-product of the childful config.**  The `configOf` children flatMap emits one
`ChildData ⟨childShape (μ·D), 1, D⟩` per μ ≥ 2 factor (guard true), each evaluated by the cluster
recursion at the base-changed variable `p^{δ·D} = p^{q.1}`.  By `omChildCount_childShape` each such
factor collapses to `1 / countPivot (μ·D) (p^{q.1})`.  The product over all children equals the
`filterMap` product over the emitting factors.

NOTE (the base-change subtlety, load-bearing): the pivot is evaluated at `p^{q.1}`, NOT at `p` — the
child is entered at the node's base-changed variable `q^{δ·D}` (`omChildCount`'s recursion argument).
For `D = q.1 = 1` (the recommended single-factor case) `p^{q.1} = p`, matching the schematic target;
for `D > 1` the faithful pivot argument is `p^{q.1}`.

/-! ## 6. TARGET — the childful `omCount` closed form -/

/-- **The closed form of `omCount` on the childful single-side path shape.**  On a size-`s`,
order-1 single-side path shape carrying a nonempty side shape `shape` (positive degrees `1 ≤ D`,
positive multiplicities `1 ≤ μ`, correct side degree `Σ D·μ = sideDeg pr`, and every μ ≥ 2 factor
emitting a descent child, `hlt`), the engine's `omCount` factorizes as the per-shape residual count
`shapeCount` times the box-volume factor `p^{−(newtonExponent + sideDeg)}` times the PRODUCT of the
self-loop pivot factors `1 / countPivot (μ·D) (p^{D})` over the μ ≥ 2 factors.

The pivot product is the genuine geometric self-loop resummation `∏ 1/(1 − p^{−D·w(μ·D)})` that the
childful descent children carry — the mass ABSENT from the finite decided-cell stratum density.

FAITHFULNESS NOTE: the pivot is evaluated at the base-changed variable `p^{D}` (= `p^{q.1}`), not at
`p`; these coincide exactly when `D = 1` (the recommended single-factor case, e.g. `shape = [(1,2)]`).
The `hmpos : 1 ≤ q.2` hypothesis (positive multiplicity) is genuinely needed here — see
`cellResDeg_childful` — and holds for every `ShapesFor` shape. -/

/-! ## 7. TARGET — the childful `h_node` (with the exact pivot relation) -/

/-- **The childful `h_node`.**  For a size-`s`, order-1 single-side path `P` (one side
`pr = sidePairs P`) carrying a nonempty side shape `shape` (positive degrees, positive
multiplicities, every μ ≥ 2 factor emitting a child), the genuine order-1 stratum density
`stratumCount1 s N (mkCell s P [shape]) / p^(s·N)` converges (as `N → ∞`) to the FINITE
decided-cell value `shapeCount p shape · p^{−(newtonExponent + sideDeg)}`.

DECISIVE PIVOT FINDING (resolving the pivot-mismatch risk).  The limit is the RAW finite value
`shapeCount·p^{−V}`, which is NOT the engine `omCount` on the childful shape.  By
`omCount_oneSideShapeChildful_closed`,
  `omCount (oneSideShapeChildful s pr shape) p = (limit) · ∏ 1/countPivot(μ·D)(p^{D})`,
so the density limit is the engine value with the self-loop pivot product DIVIDED OUT — the pivot
mass is exactly the self-loop resummation the single-decided-cell density does not capture.  Hence
the faithful h_node states `limit = shapeCount·p^{−V}` (option (a) of the risk analysis: the honest
stratum value), and the companion identity `pivot_relation` below records
`omCount = limit · ∏ pivot`.

The stratum-side Steps A–C are μ-agnostic and coincide verbatim with `hnode_oneSideShape`
(`hnode_decided_order1` + `mkCell_volExp_add_freeExp`, neither of which sees the cell's children). -/

/-! ## 8. The companion pivot relation (`omCount = limit · ∏ pivot`) -/

/-- **The exact pivot relation.**  The engine `omCount` of the childful shape equals the finite
stratum density limit (`hnode_oneSideShapeChildful`'s RHS) times the self-loop pivot product.  This
is the precise algebraic statement of the pivot mismatch: `omCount ≠ limit` (they differ by the
pivot product), so a childful h_node CANNOT be the clean `limit = omCount` identity that the
childless `hnode_oneSideShape` enjoys.  Immediate from `omCount_oneSideShapeChildful_closed`. -/
