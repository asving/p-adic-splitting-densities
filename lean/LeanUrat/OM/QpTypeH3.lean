# QpTypeH3 — the axiom-free H = 3 anchor for the W3c axiom re-scope
(Wild Wave 3c, `notes/WILD_WAVE3_BLUEPRINT_2026-07-21.md` §2 item 4; 2026-07-21)

The W3c re-scope extends `om_leaf_faithful` (`OM/OmLeafFaithful.lean`) from the Wave-1 menu
`WildMenu.omMenuW` to the K-windowed `WildMenuW3.omMenuW3`. The NEW menu content at `n = 2`,
`σ = {(2,1)}` is the height-3 window leg `ramShapeAt 2 σ 3 = Tselfloop 2 ((0,3),(2,0)) [(1,1)]`
(the `k = 3` admissible multiplier). THIS module is the axiom-free machine anchor pinning the
re-scoped axiom's payload at that new leg — the H = 3 mirror of the Wave-2 anchors
`QpType.wildGateFiber_eisenstein` (H = 1 irreducibility) and `QpTypeEisenstein.gate_ef_forced`
(H = 1 fine-(e,f)):

* `wildH3_irreducible'` / `wildH3_irreducible` — **the elementary two-root valuation
  contradiction** (blueprint §2 item 4; NO Newton polygon): monic quadratic `f` over `ℤ_[p]`
  with `v(a₀) = 3` and `a₁ ∈ (p)²` is irreducible over ℚ_p. If `f` were reducible, monic
  quadratic reducibility over the integrally closed `ℤ_[p]` gives roots `a₀ = c₁·c₂`,
  `a₁ = c₁ + c₂` IN `ℤ_[p]` (`Monic.not_irreducible_iff_exists_add_mul_eq_coeff` + Gauss
  transfer `Monic.irreducible_iff_irreducible_map_fraction_map`); then
  `v(c₁) + v(c₂) = 3`, WLOG `v(c₁) ≤ v(c₂)` forces `v(c₁) ≤ 1 < 2 ≤ v(c₂)`, so
  `v(a₁) = v(c₁ + c₂) = v(c₁) ≤ 1`, contradicting `v(a₁) ≥ 2`. The primary form is the
  MEMBERSHIP form `a₁ ∈ (maximalIdeal ℤ_[p])²` (faithful under mathlib's `v(0) = 0`
  convention); the blueprint-literal disjunct form (`2 ≤ v(a₁) ∨ a₁ = 0`) is derived.
* `wildH3Fiber_valuation` / `wildH3Fiber_irreducible` — the fiber link: membership of a genuine
  monic quadratic in the LEVEL-N CLASSIFIER FIBER of the H = 3 window shape (`N ≥ 4`) forces
  `v(a₀) = 3 ∧ a₁ ∈ (p)²` (via `classify_eq_selfloop_iff` + the decode bridge — the digit
  conditions of the side `(0,3)–(2,0)` read `vOf 0 = 3`, `vOf 1 ≥ ⌈3/2⌉ = 2`), hence
  irreducibility over ℚ_p. Mirrors `QpType.wildGateFiber_valuation`/`_eisenstein` verbatim.
* `h3Fiber_nonempty` — the concrete H = 3 fiber witness: `f0 = X² + 4X + 8` over `ℤ_[2]` at
  level `N = 5` (`v(a₀) = 3`, `v(a₁) = 2`; `InCell` proved directly from the digit conditions —
  the banked `CellMenu` gates are all at `N = 3`, below the H = 3 threshold `N₀ = 4`, so no
  banked cell exists for this stratum). The re-scoped axiom's H = 3 instance quantifies over a
  genuinely NONEMPTY fiber: the mutation probes below have real force.
* `ef_of_wildH3` / `gate_h3_ef_forced` — **route (a), the parity argument (blueprint §2
  item 4)**: for ANY `LocalFactorData` bundle on an H = 3 fiber member, `(e, f) = (2, 1)`.
  H = 3 members are NOT Eisenstein (`v(a₀) = 3 ≠ 1`), so `QpTypeEisenstein.ef_of_eisenstein`
  does not apply; instead: the fundamental identity `e·f = [L:ℚ_p] = 2` leaves `e ∈ {1, 2}`,
  and `e = 1` is refuted by parity — with `algebraMap p = u·ϖ` (`e = 1`), the root equation
  `y² = −(a₀ + a₁y)` in the DVR `O` has ϖ-order exactly 3 on `a₀`, `≥ 2 + k` on `a₁y`, and
  exactly `2k` on `y²` (`y = u_y·ϖᵏ`): `k ≤ 1` makes the RHS divisible by `ϖ^{2k+1}` but not
  the LHS; `k ≥ 2` makes `ϖ⁴ ∣ a₀` — both machine-refuted by pure divisibility in the DVR
  (no valuation function needed). **Honest scope**: the bundle slot `D` is exactly the
  existence content the axiom carries (mathlib at the pin cannot CONSTRUCT a bundle for a wild
  quadratic); like `QpTypeEisenstein.gate_ef_forced`, this theorem is the machine GUARD that
  any carried bundle's `(e,f)` payload is forced — consumed contrapositively by the fine-swap
  mutation probe.
* `ramShapeAt_h3` / `h3_mem_omMenuW3` — the W3-menu bookkeeping: the H = 3 literal IS
  `WildMenuW3.ramShapeAt 2 ⟨{(2,1)}⟩ 3`, and it is a member of the window-3 menu
  `omMenuW3 2 3 ⟨{(2,1)}⟩` (the probe's `hT` leg).
* **Mutation probes (§2 item 4 last bullet)**: both the SPLIT-TYPE mutation `{(1,1),(1,1)}`
  and the FINE-(e,f)-SWAP mutation `{(1,2)}` of the RE-SCOPED axiom derive machine-checked
  `False` at the H = 3 stratum — scratches NOT committed; verbatim text + output recorded in
  the two `Mutation probe evidence` comment blocks below.

Leaf module: no existing file is modified (the census append to `AxChk_baseline.lean` is Part C
of the wave). **No axiom, no sorry** — every declaration here must be core-only (AxCheck at
bottom).

degree-2 `f` over `ℤ_[p]` with `v(a₀) = 3` and `a₁ ∈ (p)²` is irreducible over ℚ_p.

Route (blueprint §2 item 4, NO Newton polygon): reducibility of the monic quadratic over the
fraction field transfers to `ℤ_[p]` (Gauss, `irreducible_iff_irreducible_map_fraction_map`),
where it means `a₀ = c₁·c₂`, `a₁ = c₁ + c₂` (`not_irreducible_iff_exists_add_mul_eq_coeff`).
Then `v(c₁) + v(c₂) = 3`; WLOG `v(c₁) ≤ v(c₂)`, so `2·v(c₁) ≤ 3` gives `v(c₁) ≤ 1` and
`v(c₂) = 3 − v(c₁) ≥ 2 > v(c₁)`; the ultrametric then pins `v(a₁) = v(c₁) ≤ 1 < 2`,
contradicting `a₁ ∈ (p)²`. (`a₁ = 0` is impossible: `c₂ = −c₁` would force `2·v(c₁) = 3`.) -/

/-- **The H = 3 `(e, f)` theorem (master form, axiom-free — route (a), the parity argument).**
For monic degree-2 `f` over `ℤ_[p]` with `v(a₀) = 3` and `a₁ ∈ (p)²`, EVERY local-factor
bundle `D : LocalFactorData p f` has `eOf p D = 2` and `fOf p D = 1`.

Route: the fundamental identity `e·f = [L:ℚ_p] = 2` (instance stack as in
`QpTypeEisenstein.ef_of_eisenstein`) leaves `e ∈ {1, 2}`; `e = 1` is refuted by PARITY. With
`algebraMap p = u_p·ϖ` (that is `e = 1`), the descended root `y = u_y·ϖᵏ` of
`y² = −(a₀ + a₁·y)` gives ϖ-order exactly `3` on `a₀ = w·p³` (`w` the unit coefficient of
`v(a₀) = 3`), `≥ 2 + k` on `a₁·y` (`a₁ = p²·b`), and exactly `2k` on `y²`: for `k ≤ 1` the RHS
is divisible by `ϖ^{2k+1}` but the LHS is not (`not_pow_succ_dvd_unit_mul_pow`); for `k ≥ 2`
the RHS forces `ϖ⁴ ∣ w·p³` — a unit times `ϖ³` — likewise impossible. Pure divisibility in the
DVR; no valuation function.

**Honest scope**: the bundle slot `D` is exactly the existence content `om_leaf_faithful`
carries (mathlib at the pin cannot construct a bundle for a wild quadratic; same status as
`QpTypeEisenstein.gate_ef_forced`) — this theorem GUARDS the payload of any carried bundle. -/

'LeanUrat.OM.QpTypeH3ScratchSwap.mutation_efswap_w3_refuted' depends on axioms: [propext,

Together the two probes pin the re-scoped axiom's payload at its NEW menu content (the H = 3
window leg) in BOTH coordinates — factor count AND `(e,f)` — against purely axiom-free
anchors, exactly as the W2 probes pinned the H = 1 gate. -/
