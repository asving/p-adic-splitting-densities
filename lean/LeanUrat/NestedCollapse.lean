# LeanUrat.NestedCollapse — the corrected crux: the well-founded NESTED multi-block recursion

This is the corrected self-loop collapse of `notes/DECOMP_BLUEPRINT.tex` §4 (Theorem `thm:nested`,
the fix [F1]). The size-`s` completely-split cluster volume `I_s` is **NOT** a single geometric
series for `s ≥ 3`; it satisfies a well-founded NESTED multi-block recursion. The single geometric
series is only the `s = 2` special case (`lem:s2`).

## The nested recursion (blueprint `eq:nested`)

```
  I_s · (1 − q^{-w(s)})  =  Σ_{P ⊢ {1,…,s}, #P = r ≥ 2}  [ Π_{j=0}^{r-1}(q − j) ]
                                                          · Π_{B ∈ P} q^{-(|B| + C(|B|,2))} · I_{|B|},
  I_0 = I_1 = 1,   w(s) = s(s+1)/2 − 1.
```

* The sum is over set-partitions `P` of `{1,…,s}` into `r ≥ 2` nonempty blocks (`Finpartition` of
  `Finset.range s`, filtered to `parts.card ≥ 2`).
* `Π_{j=0}^{r-1}(q − j)` is the falling factorial `q^{\underline r}` = `Nat.descFactorial q r` (the
  number of ways to assign `r` DISTINCT residues to the `r` labelled blocks — the cross-block
  Vandermonde factor is `1` since distinct residues give unit differences).
* `q^{-(|B| + C(|B|,2))}` is the within-block box × Vandermonde rescale (`lem:rescale` WITHOUT the
  `Q`-residue-choice, already counted by the falling factorial).
* The `r = 1` single-block "all stay together" term has been moved to the LEFT, producing the
  self-loop pivot `1 − q^{-w(s)}` on `I_s`. **Every block on the right has size `|B| < s`** (since
  `r ≥ 2`), so the recursion is WELL-FOUNDED (strict descent), terminating at `I_0 = I_1 = 1`.

## What this module provides

* `descFactorial`-based residue weight and the within-block rescale weight, fully defined;
* `nestedRHS I s q` — the right side, a `Finpartition`-sum, fully defined;
* `SatisfiesNested I` — the predicate "`I` satisfies `eq:nested` for all `s ≥ 2`" (the crux
  recursion, as a STATEMENT);
* `nested_wellFounded` — the strict-descent fact `|B| < s` for every block of a `≥2`-block partition
  (PROVED — this is what makes the recursion well-founded and is the load-bearing structural point);
* the closed-form CHECKS `I_2 = q/(q+1)`, `I_3 = q^3(q^2−q+1)/((q+1)·Φ_5)` as the intended solution
  (`closedI2`, `closedI3`), and the statement that the nested solution reproduces them
  (`nested_reproduces_I2`, `nested_reproduces_I3`);
* the **geometric LIMIT** upgrade (`geometricLimit_of_selfLoop`): the finite truncations
  `V_N = a(1 − r^{N+1})/(1 − r)` converge to `a/(1 − r)`, the COUNTING limit, upgrading the algebraic
  `selfLoop_geometric`.

## Status

PROVED (sorry-free). The recursion and weights are fully DEFINED; the well-foundedness (`|B| < s`)
and the geometric-limit upgrade are PROVED. The `s = 2` and `s = 3` closed forms
(`nested_reproduces_I2`, `nested_reproduces_I3`) are now PROVED by genuine finite computation: the
`≥2`-block set-partitions of `range 2` / `range 3` are enumerated explicitly (one / four of them,
the `Finpartition`-enumeration discharged by `decide`), the per-partition falling-factorial and
within-block weights are computed, `nestedRHS` is evaluated in closed form (`nestedRHS_two`,
`nestedRHS_three`), and the self-loop pivot `1 − q^{-w(s)}` is inverted (positivity from
`L5fix.selfLoop_geometric`), reproducing `I_2 = q/(q+1)` and `I_3 = q^3(q^2−q+1)/((q+1)Φ_5)`.
`SatisfiesNested` is a PREDICATE (the crux equation), not an axiom — it is something a constructed
`I` must satisfy, not an assumed conclusion. NO `sorry`, NO `axiom` in this module.

/-- The within-block rescale exponent `|B| + C(|B|,2)` for a block of size `b = |B|`

factorial (`Nat.descFactorial`): the number of ways to assign `r` DISTINCT residues in `F_q` to the
`r` labelled blocks of the partition. -/
def residueWeight (q r : ℕ) : ℚ := (q.descFactorial r : ℚ)

/-- The per-partition weight in `eq:nested`: the residue-assignment falling factorial times the

per-partition weight. We sum over `Finpartition (range s)` filtered to `parts.card ≥ 2` (the `r ≥ 2`
condition; the `r = 1` single block has been moved to the LHS pivot). -/
noncomputable def nestedRHS (I : ℕ → ℕ → ℚ) (s q : ℕ) : ℚ :=

card) satisfies the nested multi-block recursion: base `I_0 = I_1 = 1`, and for `s ≥ 2`,
`I_s · (1 − q^{-w(s)}) = nestedRHS I s q`.

This is a STATEMENT a constructed `I` must satisfy (the crux), NOT an axiom asserting a conclusion:
it is the self-loop-collapse equation derived from M1 + C1 + counting, and its solution's rationality
is what the rationality theorem proves. `w = L5fix.selfLoopExponent`. -/

/-! ### Well-foundedness: every block of a `≥2`-block partition is STRICTLY smaller

This is the load-bearing structural point of the corrected crux: because `r ≥ 2`, each block `B` in
the sum has `|B| < s`, so the recursion descends strictly and terminates at `I_0 = I_1 = 1`. PROVED. -/

/-- **Strict descent (well-foundedness of `eq:nested`).** For a partition `P` of `range s` with at
least `2` parts, every part `B ∈ P.parts` has `B.card < s`. So every `I_{|B|}` on the RHS is a
STRICTLY smaller instance — the recursion is well-founded. PROVED. -/

/-! #### The explicit set-partitions enumerated by `nestedRHS` at `s = 2, 3`

To evaluate `nestedRHS I s q` at `s = 2, 3` we must enumerate the `≥2`-block set-partitions of
`Finset.range s`. For `s = 2` there is exactly one (`⊥`, the two singletons). For `s = 3` there are
exactly four: the three-singleton `⊥`, and the three `{size-2, size-1}` partitions. We name the four
size-`3` partitions so the `Finset.sum` over the filtered universe can be unfolded by
`Finset.sum_insert`. Each carries its three `Finpartition` obligations discharged by `decide`. -/

/-! ### The geometric LIMIT upgrade (blueprint `lem:collapse`, `eq:limit`)

The `s = 2` collapse (and the pivot in the nested system) is the limit of FINITE geometric sums, not
merely the algebraic identity `Σ r^j = 1/(1−r)`. We upgrade `L5fix.selfLoop_geometric`'s algebraic
content to the COUNTING limit: `V_N = a(1 − r^{N+1})/(1 − r) → a/(1 − r)`. -/

/-- **The geometric LIMIT (`eq:limit`, the counting upgrade of `selfLoop_geometric`).** For
`0 < r < 1`, the finite truncations `V_N = a(1 − r^{N+1})/(1 − r)` converge to `a/(1 − r)`. This is
the COUNTING limit `lim_N V_N` of `lem:collapse` — the level-`N` finite geometric sums tending to the
rational value — NOT just the algebraic identity. PROVED (`r^{N+1} → 0` for `|r| < 1`). -/
