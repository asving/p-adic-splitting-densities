# LeanUrat.Witness — non-vacuity of the `DensityFoundation` interface (GAP-2 fix)

`Goal.goal_theorem` and `Interface.clusterVolume_rational` are stated `∀ F : DensityFoundation, …`.
Before this file, `DensityFoundation` had **zero** instances, so an `∀ F` statement was honest about
its hypotheses but had **never been witnessed to be non-vacuous** (no concrete `F` was known to
exist). This file constructs one explicit `witnessFoundation : DensityFoundation`, proving the
interface is **inhabited** (`DensityFoundation_nonempty`).

## HONEST SCOPE — what this does and does NOT establish (GAP-2)

* **It DOES** establish non-vacuity: the `DensityFoundation` hypothesis-bundle is jointly
  satisfiable (its equational fields — `decomposition`, `clusterVolume_eq_measure`, `density_nonneg` —
  are mutually consistent), so the `∀ F` theorems are not vacuously quantifying over an empty type,
  and the structural OM-bridge fields can be simultaneously met. In particular `goal_theorem` and
  `clusterVolume_rational` have at least one genuine instance to which they apply.

* **It does NOT** establish that any constructed `F.density` is the REAL `p`-adic factorization-type
  density `ρ(n,σ;q)` of the paper. The witness's `density` is the trivial `0` (with `shapes := ∅`),
  chosen only to satisfy the structural identities; it is NOT an honest Haar volume. Constructing a
  `DensityFoundation` whose `density` IS the paper's `ρ` requires `p`-adic Haar integration, which
  **mathlib v4.31.0 lacks** (no `MeasureSpace`/`haarMeasure` on `PadicInt`/any DVR; grep of
  `Mathlib/MeasureTheory` for `Padic` is empty). That is the genuine, un-crossed measure wall.

So the honest reading of `goal_theorem` is: *for every abstract `DensityFoundation` `F` (a structure
recording the cited measure-foundational identities), `F.density` is a uniform palindromic rational
function of `q`; such `F` exist; but identifying a specific `F` with the paper's `ρ` is the
un-constructed `p`-adic-Haar measure foundation.* `Goal.goal_theorem`'s docstring is relabeled to
state exactly this. -/

* `density_nonneg`: `0 ≤ 0`.

The OM bridge (`decode`/`clusterVolume_eq_measure`) was FACTORED OUT of `DensityFoundation` into the
separate `OMBridge` structure (2026-06-20); the witness bridge is `witnessOMBridge` below. So the
(now measure-free) `witnessFoundation` no longer references `PadicMeasure.clusterMeasure` in its
structural fields — though its `clusterVolume` field still picks the concrete `clusterMeasure
minimalOMShape` value so the bridge is satisfiable.

This proves the interface is INHABITED; it does NOT make `density` the paper's `ρ` (see file header). -/

/-- **The witness `OMBridge` for `witnessFoundation` (non-vacuity of the SEPARATED OM bridge).**
`decode := fun _ => minimalOMShape`, and `clusterVolume_eq_measure` is `rfl` because
`witnessFoundation.clusterVolume T q = clusterMeasure minimalOMShape q = clusterMeasure (decode T) q`.
This shows the factored-out `OMBridge` structure is itself inhabited over the witness, so the OLD
measure-route theorems (`clusterVolume_rational`, `goal_theorem`) — which now take `(F, B : OMBridge F)`
— are non-vacuous. -/

/-- **GAP-2 non-vacuity: `DensityFoundation` is inhabited.** Hence the genuine `∀ F : DensityFoundation`
theorems (`clusterVolume_rational`, `goal_theorem`) are not vacuous over an empty type. The OM bridge
is separately inhabited (`witnessOMBridge`), so the OLD measure-route theorems' `(F, B)` hypotheses are
jointly satisfiable. (This does NOT identify the witness `density` with the real `ρ` — see file header
/ `Goal.goal_theorem`'s relabeled docstring.)

**NOTE (2026-06-21):** this inhabits ONLY `DensityFoundation`. That is NOT sufficient for
`Goal.goal_theorem_montes`, whose coupled bundle `(M, D, F, hbridge)` ties `F` to a `MontesData D` —
and `witnessFoundation` (density ≡ 0) is incompatible with any non-trivial `D`. The full-bundle
non-vacuity of `goal_theorem_montes` is established separately by `montes_bundle_nonempty` /
`montes_full_instance` below (a genuine coupled `CountingModel`/`MontesData`/foundation witness with
non-trivial density `1`). -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity of the FULL `goal_theorem_montes` bundle (Witness-nit fix, 2026-06-21)

The audit flagged that `DensityFoundation_nonempty` only inhabits `DensityFoundation`, which is
NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for `Goal.goal_theorem_montes`: that theorem takes the coupled bundle
`(M : CountingModel q n) (D : MontesData q n M) (σ) (F : DensityFoundation) (hσ) (hbridge)`, where
`hbridge : ∀ q' > 1, F.density n σ q' = ∑_T D.coeff T q'` COUPLES `F` to `D`. The trivial
`witnessFoundation` (density ≡ 0) is in fact INCOMPATIBLE with any non-trivial `D` (it would force
`0 = ∑_T D.coeff T q'`). So we construct a genuine coupled witness — a complete `CountingModel`,
`MontesData` (with the NEW box-wise fields), and a foundation whose density IS the count-native
tree-sum — and prove the whole bundle is JOINTLY SATISFIABLE with a NON-TRIVIAL density `g ≡ 1`.

This crosses NO measure wall: `trivM` is a trivial degree-0 model (`q=2, n=0`), not the paper's
`p`-adic `ρ`; that honest limitation stands. The point is only that `goal_theorem_montes`'s hypothesis
bundle has a genuine sorry-free inhabitant (so the theorem is demonstrably non-vacuous), and the
NEW minimal box-wise axiom `boxHaarEquidist` / `nodeMeasure_boxSum` is itself satisfiable. -/
