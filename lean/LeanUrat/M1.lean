# LeanUrat.M1 — the monic → projective density bridge (`notes/M1_bridge.md`)

**Cleaned 2026-06-15.** Removed two vacuous declarations: `symPow_P1_count` (stated as `X = X := rfl`
— the crux `#(Sym^n P^1) = |P^n|` never actually appeared) and `monic_to_projective` (a
`(h : P) : P := h` tautology). The genuine bridge content (`ρ = (1/|P^n(F_q)|)·Σ_D W_D[σ]` and the
crux count `Sym^n P^1 = P^n`) is a cited combinatorial/measure fact; it is **not** faked here, and
the Goal does not depend on it (the Goal's rationality flows through `L6M4` + the named axioms). A
future module may state `Sym^n P^1 = P^n` as a real cardinality theorem.

What remains is genuinely proved: the projective normalization constant and the (definitional)
reciprocal cluster-law identities `L_e^{(δ)}(q) = L_e^{(1)}(q^δ) = α(e; q^{-δ})` (the `q ↦ 1/q`
chart swap that makes monic non-palindromic but projective palindromic).
